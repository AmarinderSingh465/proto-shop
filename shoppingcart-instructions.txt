    First, you need to create a data store or a 
    Pinia store to manage the state of your shopping cart.
    You can use the Vue CLI to create a new project with 
    Pinia and the necessary dependencies.

    Next, you need to create a component 
    for your shopping cart that displays the items in the 
    cart, their prices, and the total cost.

    You will then need to add the ability to add items to the cart. 
    This can be done using an "Add to Cart" button on the product page, 
    which will trigger a function that adds the selected item to the cart in 
    the Pinia store.

    You will also need to add the ability to remove items from the cart. 
    This can be done using a "Remove from Cart" button that triggers a 
    function that removes the item from the cart in the Pinia store.

    You will also need to add the ability to update the quantity of items in the cart. 
    This can be done using an input field that allows the user to change the quantity of the item in the cart, 
    which will trigger a function that updates the quantity in the Pinia store.

    Finally, you will need to integrate the shopping cart with your 
    checkout process. This can be done using a "Checkout" button 
    that redirects the user to the checkout page with the items in their cart.
